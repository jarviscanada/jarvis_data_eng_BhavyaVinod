I am a results-oriented person who is passionate about software development. I have more than two years of experience as an IT professional. This experience helped me to build a detail-oriented, analytical mindset and exposed me to the work culture and the agile methodologies followed in the large-scale industries. Before pursuing a career in Data Science, I completed my degree in Data analytics for business. This program covered Machine learning, Data visualization, Financial Analytics, and Advanced statistics. Through my passion to understand the needs of clients and the ability to quickly learn new technologies, I will be a great fit to the team.

**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_BhavyaVinod/tree/masterhttps://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_BhavyaVinod/tree/develop/linux_sql)]: Implemented a Linux/ SQL cluster monitoring solution to collect hardware specifications of each nodes and monitors resource usage such as CPU and memory utilization in real time. The collected data will be stored in a PostgreSQL server that runs inside a docker.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_BhavyaVinod/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - JDBC App:Created an application using JDBC API to perform CRUD operations on a PostgreSQL database. App functionality implemented using the DAO design pattern. 
  - Grep App:Developed a Java grep application on Intelij that implements grep command in Linux. This application recursively searches for a user input text pattern in the directory for lines that match the specified regular expression. The implemented code was then optimized using Lambda and Stream API.
